# Spar Nord Bank ATM Transactions Analysis 🏦💰📊

## Overview

This project aims to analyze Spar Nord Bank's ATM transaction data to gain insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and potential cost-saving opportunities. By utilizing data engineering, data analytics, and data visualization techniques, we uncover valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes and optimize the bank's ATM network.

## Architecture 🏗️

The project architecture comprises several components, each contributing to the comprehensive analysis process:

- **Data Engineering:** The data is extracted from RDS using Sqoop, then processed using an ETL pipeline. The architecture ensures accurate and efficient processing of the data flow.
- **Data Modeling:** An entity-relationship (ER) diagram is designed to illustrate data relationships, providing a clear understanding of the data flow and interconnections.
- **ETL Pipeline:** The data is extracted, transformed, and loaded into Redshift Data Warehouse using Glue for analysis.

## Data Engineering 🛠️

- **Importing Data:** We extract Spar Nord Bank ATM transaction data from RDS using Sqoop.
- **Data Cleaning:** Using PySpark on Google Colab, we clean the data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct data types.
- **ETL Process:** We perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations, preparing the data for analysis. The data is transformed and loaded into the Redshift Data Warehouse using Glue.

## Data Analytics and Visualization 📊📈

- **Data Analytics:** Amazon Redshift, a cloud-based data warehouse, enables fast querying and processing of large datasets for data analysis.
- **Key Insights:** Our analysis uncovers trends in ATM usage by time of day, day of the week, and location. We also identify correlations between ATM usage and weather conditions.
- **Data Visualization:** Line charts, bar charts, and other visualizations are used to effectively communicate trends and insights discovered through data analysis.

## Conclusion 🎉

Through comprehensive data analysis, our project provides valuable insights into Spar Nord Bank's ATM transaction data:

- **Customer Behavior Insights:** We discover peak transaction times and preferred payment methods, enabling informed decision-making processes.
- **Cost-Saving Opportunities:** Non-peak time periods are identified as optimal for ATM refills, potentially leading to cost savings on refilling operations.
  
Our project underscores the significance of data-driven optimization in enhancing customer experience, optimizing operations, and achieving cost efficiency.
